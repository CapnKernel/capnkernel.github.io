 I'm not sure there was any particular evil overlord behind Soviet wrecking; it was just a convenient bogeyman on which to blame failure to meet utopian standards.</p><p>Or perhaps communists, or aliens, are behind it.  Communist aliens even!  I don't know.  All I know is I still don't have completely working code that meets my requirements, and I'm pretty sick of wasting time trying to get ChatGPT to provide it.</p><p>Update: I've recently been using <a href="https://chat.deepseek.com/">DeepSeek</a>.  It's <em>miles</em> better.  It's rarely wrong, and it does a much better job of understanding the whole of the problem, as if its <em>attention span</em> was better.  DeepSeek is actually useful.  Oh, and the chat mode is free, so you can talk and talk, and it won't suddenly say "well that's it for today, unless you pay me money".  </p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on October 13, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://capnkernel.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://capnkernel.github.io/authors/mitch/" rel="author">Mitch</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://capnkernel.github.io/using-virtual-environments-to-separate-project-and-os-python-software.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Using virtual environments to separate project and OS Python software</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://capnkernel.github.io/inventree-100-install.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Inventree 1.0.x install</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://capnkernel.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://capnkernel.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
