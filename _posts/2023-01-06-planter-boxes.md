title: "Planter boxes using corflute and milk crates"
---

There's no soil where we live, just a concrete space.  Everything we plant has
to be in a container of some sort, and our soil (3mÂ² of it) was shipped in on
a truck:

When exploring container ideas, we wanted something that was cheap, and that
was deep enough for growing vegetables.  If soil isn't deep enough, vegies
either grow extremely slowly, go straight to seed, or both.  I kept my eye out
for options which minimised cost while being deep enough.  Some experiments
showed me that plastic milk crates are deep enough, and can be found in large
quantities out the back of cafes and supermarkets.  And what to line the crates
with?  I found a large stack of corflute (corrugated plastic) that had been
used for advertising.  The sheets aren't small: 2.4m x 0.9m.

At first I tried eyeballing how to cut out the corflute, however I kept
having problems with not correctly allowing for how the flaps I wanted
between the panels would alter the other dimensions.  Also, upon folding up
the cut-out corflute, they were either a little too large, or a little too
small.  After finding something that was almost right, I decided to do things
_the right way_ and design the corflute cutout in [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/).  FreeCAD has a
mode called "[Sheet Metal Workbench](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/SheetMetal_Workbench)", which will take a shape made of 3D planes,
and open it out into a flat shape that can be refolded back into the original.

Here's the box.  I started with the base, then added the back, then from there
went around adding each side.  Finally I added flaps for the bottom joins and
side join.

Here's a detail of a corner up close:

At bottom left is the base, then attached to that on the right is the back.  From
 there I added the greenish-tinted side, and from there through the yellow-tinted
fold, the flap.  Finally I used the sheet metal workbench to unfold the shape.
The blue lines show where to cut all the way through the corflute, and the green
lines show where to only cut one side of the corflute, making a hinge.

I tried marking this shape out on corflute, but it took a long time each time,
and it was very easy to make mistakes.  Since the shape is the same every time,
what I need is a template!  I worked out that Officeworks will print onto [A0
paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_216#Dimensions_of_A,_B_and_C_series) for $5, so I plotted the shape 1:1 into an A0-sized PDF.  The shape only
just fits, jutting over the border slightly.

I cut out the printout, and glued it to 3mm MDF with PVA glue.  Then I used
a power jigsaw to cut the MDF to shape.

Now I can just lay the template on a half-sheet of corflute, mark around it
with pencil, remove the template, then cut along the pencil lines with a
utility knife and a steel ruler.  Marking and cutting takes 10-15 minutes.
The blanks fold up very nicely and fit snugly within the milk crate.  Since
the milk crate panels are about 30cm on a side, I can cut four L-shaped
blanks from a single sheet of corflute, leaving just a 30x60cm piece
from the middle that I can use for something else.

I'm planning to make a lot more of these boxes, and now that I have a template,
it's quite quick and reproducible.  There'll be a lot more of these soon.

Bonus: I also made a deeper box (shown above) using corflute and planks from a
shipping pallet, held together with tek screws.  It's really rough, only
intended to last one season:

This box is especially suited to plants with taproots, such as radishes.
